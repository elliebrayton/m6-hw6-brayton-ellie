The most difficult part of this assignment was the first part, but I used querySelectAll from the W3Schools site 
The live lecture kind of helped, but I wish it was more concise and to the point
I also realize that there are multiple ways of achieving the same goal, which makes things a bit more confusing if your still iffy on the concepts to begin with
